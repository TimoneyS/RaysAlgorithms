/**
 * Description :
 *   Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
 *   
 *   Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 *   
 *   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
 *   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
 *   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input:
{1,#,2,2}
Output:
[2]

Explanation:
