/**
 * Description :
 *   Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, returnÂ the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: root = {2,1}
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *   Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.
 *   
 *   The given tree {2,1} is represented by the following diagram:
 *   
 *         2
 *        / 
 *       1
 *   
 *   while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
 *   ```
 *   **Example 2:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: root = {4,2,6,1,3}
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *   Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.
 *   
 *   The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:
 *   
 *             4
 *           /   \
 *         2      6
 *        / \    
 *       1   3  
 *   
 *   while the minimum difference in this tree is 1.
 *   ```
