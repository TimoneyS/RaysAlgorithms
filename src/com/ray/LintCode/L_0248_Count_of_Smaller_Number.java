 * 描述：
 *      Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array, value from 0 to 10000) and an query list. For each query, give you an integer, return the number of element in the array that are smaller than the given integer.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example 1:**
 *      ```
 *      Input: array =[1,2,7,8,5] queries =[1,8,5]
 *      Output:[0,4,2]
 *      ```
 *      
 *      **Example 2:**
 *      ```
 *      Input: array =[3,4,5,8] queries =[2,4]
 *      Output:[0,1]
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *      Could you use three ways to do it.
 *      
 *      1. Just loop
 *      2. Sort and binary search
