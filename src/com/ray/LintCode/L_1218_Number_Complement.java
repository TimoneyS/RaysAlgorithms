/**
 * Description :
 *   Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```
