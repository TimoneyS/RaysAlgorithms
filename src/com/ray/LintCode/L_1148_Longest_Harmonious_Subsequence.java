/**
 * Description :
 *   We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
 *   
 *   Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
 *
 * Example :
 *   Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
 *   Output: 5
 *   Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
 *
 * Challenge :
