/**
 * 描述：
 *      Given a boolean 2D matrix, `0` is represented as the sea, `1` is represented as the island. If two 1 is adjacent, we consider them in the same island. We only consider `up/down/left/right` adjacent.
 *      
 *      Find the number of islands that size bigger or equal than `K`.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example1**
 *      ```
 *      Input: 
 *      [[1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1]]
 *      2
 *      Output: 2
 *      Explanation:
 *      the 2D grid is
 *      [
 *        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 *        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
 *        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
 *        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 *        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
 *      ]
 *      there are two island which size is equals to 3.
 *      ```
 *      **Example2**
 *      ```
 *      Input: 
 *      [[1,0],[0,1]]
 *      1
 *      Output: 2
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
