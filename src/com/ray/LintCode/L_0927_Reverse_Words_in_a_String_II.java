/**
 * Description :
 *   Given an input `character array`, reverse the array word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input character array does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example1**

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example2**

```
Input: "a b c"
Output: "c b a"
```
 *
 * Challenge :
 *   Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
