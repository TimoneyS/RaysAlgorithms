/**
 * Description :
 *   There are `n` cities connected by some flights. Each flight (u, v, w) starts from city u and arrives at v with a price w.
 *   
 *   Given `n`, `flights`, together with starting city `src` and the destination `dst`, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with at most `K` stops.
 *   
 *   If there is no such route, return `-1`.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
 *   
 *   ```
 *   Input: 
 *     n = 3,
 *     flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]],
 *     src = 0, dst = 2, K = 0
 *   Output: 500
 *   ```
 *   
 *   **Example 2:**
 *   
 *   ```
 *   Input: 
 *     n = 3,
 *     flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]],
 *     src = 0, dst = 2, K = 1
 *   Output: 200
 *   ```
