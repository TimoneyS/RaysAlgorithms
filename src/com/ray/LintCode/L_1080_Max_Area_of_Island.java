/**
 * Description :
 *   Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 *   
 *   Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
input:
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
output : 6.
Explanation : Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**
```
input: [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
output : 0
```
