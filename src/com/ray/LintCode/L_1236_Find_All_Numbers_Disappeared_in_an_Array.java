/**
 * Description :
 *   Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
 *   
 *   Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
 *   
 *   Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
 *
 * Example :
 *   Input:
 *   [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 *   
 *   Output:
 *   [5,6]
