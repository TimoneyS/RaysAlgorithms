/**
 * Description :
 *   Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
 *   
 *   Output: 1
 *   
 *   Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
 *   ```
 *   **Example 2:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
 *   
 *   Output: 2
 *   
 *   Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
 *   ```
 *   **Example 3:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
 *   
 *   Output: 0
 *   
 *   Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 *   ```
