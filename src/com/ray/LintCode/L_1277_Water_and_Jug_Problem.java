 * Description :
 *   You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly z litres using these two jugs.

If z liters of water is measurable, you must have z liters of water contained within **one or both buckets** by the end.

Operations allowed:

* Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
* Empty any of the jugs.
* Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example1**
```
Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
Output: True
```
**Example2**
```
Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
Output: False
```
