/**
 * 描述：
 *      Given two array of integers(the first array is array `A`, the second array is array `B`), now we are going to find a element in array A which is A[i], and another element in array B which is B[j], so that the difference between A[i] and B[j] (|A[i] - B[j]|) is as small as possible, return their smallest difference.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example 1:**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: A = [3, 6, 7, 4], B = [2, 8, 9, 3]
 *      Output: 0
 *      Explanation: A[0] - B[3] = 0
 *      ```
 *      
 *      **Example 2:**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: A = [1, 2, 3, 4], B = [7, 6, 5]
 *      Output: 1
 *      Explanation: B[2] - A[3] = 1
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *      O(*n* log *n*) time
 *
 * 难度： Medium
