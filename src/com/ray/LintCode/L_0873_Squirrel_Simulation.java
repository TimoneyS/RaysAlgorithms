/**
 * 描述：
 *      There's a tree, a squirrel, and several nuts. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid. Your goal is to find the `minimal` distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The squirrel can only take at most `one nut` at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example 1:**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: height = 5, width = 7,
 *        treePosition = [2, 2],
 *        squirrelPosition = [4, 4],
 *        nuts = [[3, 0], [2, 5]]
 *      Output: 12
 *      ```
 *

 *      
 *      **Example 2:**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: height = 1, width = 3,
 *        treePosition = [0,1],
 *        squirrelPosition = [0,0],
 *        nuts = [[0,2]]
 *      Output: 3
 *      ```
