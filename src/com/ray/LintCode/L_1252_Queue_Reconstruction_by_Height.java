/**
 * Description :
 *   Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example1**
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```
**Example2**
```
Input:
[[2,0],[1,1]]
Output:
[[2,0],[1,1]]
```
