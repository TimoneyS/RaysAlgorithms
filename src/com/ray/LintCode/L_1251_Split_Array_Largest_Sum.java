/**
 * Description :
 *   Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, we are going to split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input：[7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output：18
Explanation：
    There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
    The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
    where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```


**Example 2:**
```
Input：[1,4,4], m = 3
Output：4
Explanation：
    There is a way to split nums into three subarrays.
    The best way is to split it into [1], [4] and [4],
    where the largest sum among the three subarrays is only 4.
```
