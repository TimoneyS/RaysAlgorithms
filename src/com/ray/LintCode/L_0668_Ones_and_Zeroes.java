/**
 * 描述：
 *      In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.
 *      
 *      For now, suppose you are a dominator of m `0s` and n `1s` respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only `0s` and `1s`.
 *      
 *      Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m `0s` and n `1s`. Each `0` and `1` can be used at most once.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example1**
 *      ```
 *      Input:
 *      ["10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"]
 *      5
 *      3
 *      Output: 4
 *      Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are "10", "0001", "1", "0"
 *      ```
 *      **Example2**
 *      ```
 *      Input:
 *      ["10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"]
 *      7
 *      7
 *      Output: 5
 *      Explanation: All strings can be formed by the using of 7 0s and 7 1s.
 *      ```
