/**
 * 描述：
 *      Given a string, count number of subsequences of the form `a^i b^j c^ k`, i.e., it consists of i `a` characters, followed by j `b` characters, followed by k `c` characters where i >= 1, j >=1 and k >= 1.
 *      
 *      Note: Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example1**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: s = "abbc"
 *      Output: 3
 *      Explanation: 
 *      Subsequences are "abc", "abc" and "abbc"
 *      ```
 *      
 *      **Example2**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: s = "abcabc"
 *      Output: 7
 *      Explanation: 
 *      Subsequences are "abc", "abc", "abbc", "aabc", "abcc", "abc" and "abc"
 *      ```
