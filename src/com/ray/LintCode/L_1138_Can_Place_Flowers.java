/**
 * Description :
 *   Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the pots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number **n**, return if **n** new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example1**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
```
**Example2**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```
 *
 * Challenge :
