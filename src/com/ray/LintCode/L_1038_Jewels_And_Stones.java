/**
 * Description :
 *   You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```
