/**
 * Description :
 *   You are given a string, `s`, and a list of words `words`. The words in `words` are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once and without any intervening characters.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodstudentgoodword",
  words = ["word","student"]
Output: []
```
 *
 * Challenge :
