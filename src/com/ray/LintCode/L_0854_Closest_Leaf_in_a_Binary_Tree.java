/**
 * 描述：
 *      Given a binary tree **where every node has a unique value**, and a target key `k`. 
 *      
 *      Find the value of the nearest leaf node to target `k` in the tree. If there are multiple cases, you should follow these priorities:
 *      
 *      1. The leaf node is in the left subtree of the node with `k`;
 *      2. The leaf node is in the right subtree of the node with `k`;
 *      3. The leaf node is not in the subtree of the node with `k`.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example 1:**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: {1, 3, 2}, k = 1
 *      Output: 3
 *      Explanation:
 *          1
 *         / \
 *        3   2
 *      ```
 *      
 *      **Example 2:**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: {1}, k = 1
 *      Output: 1
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *
