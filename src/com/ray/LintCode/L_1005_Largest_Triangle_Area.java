/**
 * Description :
 *   You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.
 *   
 *   Example:
 *   ~~~~.
 *   Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
 *   Output: 2
 *   Explanation: 
 *   The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.
 *   ~~~~
 *   
 *   ![](http://lintcode-media.s3.amazonaws.com/problem/1027.png "")
 *
 * Example :
 *   3 <= points.length <= 50.
 *   No points will be duplicated.
 *    -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
 *   Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
