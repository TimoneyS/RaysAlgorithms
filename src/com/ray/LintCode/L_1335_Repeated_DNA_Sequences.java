/**
 * Description :
 *   All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 *   
 *   Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example1**
 *   
 *   ```
 *   Input: "A"
 *   Output: []
 *   ```
 *   
 *   **Example2**
 *   
 *   ```
 *   Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
 *   Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
 *   ```
 *
 * Challenge :
