/**
 * Description :
 *   Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```
