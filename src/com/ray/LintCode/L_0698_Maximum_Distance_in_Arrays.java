/**
 * 描述：
 *      Given `m` arrays, and each array is sorted in ascending order. Now you can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the difference between two integers `a` and `b` to be their absolute difference `|a-b|`. Your task is to find the maximum difference.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example1**
 *      ```
 *      Input: [[1,2,3], [4,5], [1,2,3]]
 *      Output: 4
 *      Explanation:
 *      One way to reach the maximum difference 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.
 *      ```
 *      **Example2**
 *      ```
 *      Input: [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,10]]
 *      Output: 9
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *      
 *
 * 难度： Medium
