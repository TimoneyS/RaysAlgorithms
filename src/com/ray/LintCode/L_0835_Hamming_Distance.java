/**
 * 描述：
 *      The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
 *      Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example1**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: x = 1 and y = 4
 *      Output: 2
 *      Explanation:
 *      The binary representation of 1 is 001
 *      The binary representation of 4 is 100
 *      There are 2 different bits
 *      ```
 *      
 *      **Example2**
 *      
 *      ```
 *      Input: x = 5 and y = 2
 *      Output: 3
 *      Explanation:
 *      The binary representation of 5 is 101
 *      The binary representation of 2 is 010
 *      There are 3 different bits
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *      
 *
 * 难度： Simple
