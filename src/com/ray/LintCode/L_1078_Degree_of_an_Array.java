/**
 * Description :
 *   Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
 *   
 *   Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input: [2, 2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
