/**
 * Description :
 *   A sorted list A contains 1, plus some number of primes.  Then, for every p < q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.
 *   
 *   What is the K-th smallest fraction considered?  Return your answer as an array of ints, where answer[0] = p and answer[1] = q.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3
 *   Output: [2, 5]
 *   
 *   Explanation:
 *   The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
 *   1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.
 *   The third fraction is 2/5.
 *   ```
 *   
 *   
 *   **Example 2:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: A = [1, 7], K = 1
 *   Output: [1, 7]
 *   ```
 *
 * Challenge :
