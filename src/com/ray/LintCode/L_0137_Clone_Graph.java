/**
 * 描述：
 *      Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` and a list of its `neighbors`. Nodes are labeled uniquely.
 *      
 *      You need to return a deep copied graph, which has the same structure as the original graph, and any changes to the new graph will not have any effect on the original graph.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example1**
 *      ```
 *      Input:
 *      {1,2,4#2,1,4#4,1,2}
 *      Output: 
 *      {1,2,4#2,1,4#4,1,2}
 *      Explanation:
 *      1------2
