/**
 * 描述：
 *      Given a boolean 2D matrix, `0` is represented as the sea, `1` is represented as the island. If two 1 is adjacent, we consider them in the same island. We only consider up/down/left/right adjacent.
 *      
 *      Find the number of islands.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example 1:**
 *      ```
 *      Input:
 *      [
 *        [1,1,0,0,0],
 *        [0,1,0,0,1],
 *        [0,0,0,1,1],
 *        [0,0,0,0,0],
 *        [0,0,0,0,1]
 *      ]
 *      Output:
 *      3
 *      ```
 *      **Example 2:**
 *      ```
 *      Input:
 *      [
 *        [1,1]
 *      ]
 *      Output:
 *      1
 *      ```
