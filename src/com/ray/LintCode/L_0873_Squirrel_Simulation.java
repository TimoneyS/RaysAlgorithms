/**
 * There's a tree, a squirrel, and several nuts. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid.
 * Your goal is to find the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one.
 * The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right,
 * to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.
