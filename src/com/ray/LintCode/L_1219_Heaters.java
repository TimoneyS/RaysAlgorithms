So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,3],[2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
