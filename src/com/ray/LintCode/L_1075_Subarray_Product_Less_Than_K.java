/**
 * Description :
 *   Your are given an array of positive integers `nums`.
 *   
 *   Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than `k`.
 *
 * Example :
 *   ```
Example 1:
	Input:  nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
	Output:  8
	
	Explanation:
	The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
	Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

	
Example 2:
	Input: nums = [5,10,2], k = 10
	Output:  2
	
	Explanation:
	Only [5] and [2].
```
