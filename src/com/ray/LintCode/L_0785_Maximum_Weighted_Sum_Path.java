/**
 * 描述：
 *      A robot is located at the top-right corner of a `m x n` grid.
 *      The robot can only move either down or left at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-left corner of the grid.Every grid has a number,the robot wants to get the **max** weighted sum path.
 *      What is the maximum weighted sum path?
 *
 * 用例：
 *      Example 1:
 *      ```
 *      Input:
 *      [
 *      [1,2,3,4],
 *      [3,5,6,7],
 *      [9,10,1,2],
 *      [4,4,5,5]
 *      ]
 *      Output: 45.
 *      Explanation:
 *      The path is [4,7,6,5,10,9,4].
 *      ```
 *      Example 2:
 *      ```
 *      Input:
 *      [
 *      [1,2,3],
 *      [4,5,6],
 *      [7,9,8]
 *      ]
 *      Output:33.
 *      Explanation:
 *      The path is [3,6,8,9,7].
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *      
 *
 * 难度： Medium
