You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used **exactly** one time.

 *   Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has.

 *   **Example 1:**
 *   ```
 *   Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
 *   Output: true
 *

 *   ```
 *   
 *   **Example 2:**
