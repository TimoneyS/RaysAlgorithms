/**
 * 描述：
 *      Given n pieces of wood with length `L[i]` (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example 1**
 *      
 *      ```plain
 *      Input:
 *      L = [232, 124, 456]
 *      k = 7
 *      Output: 114
 *      Explanation: We can cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 114cm long, however we can't cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 115cm long.
 *      ```
 *      
 *      **Example 2**
 *      
 *      ```plain
 *      Input:
 *      L = [1, 2, 3]
 *      k = 7
 *      Output: 0
 *      Explanation: It is obvious we can't make it.
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *      O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.
 *
 * 难度： Hard
