/**
 * Description :
 *   Given an integer array `nums`. You need to split `nums` into several (at least 2) subsequences, where each subsequence contains at least 3 consecutive integers.

Return whether you can make such a split.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation: You can split them into two subsequences: 
  [1, 2, 3]
  [3, 4, 5]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation: You can split them into two subsequences: 
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  [3, 4, 5]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
Explanation: We can't split them into several legal subsequences.
```
