/**
 * Description :
 *   Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,4,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [5,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: n is 1, and the maximum sum of pairs is 5 = min(5, 6) .
```
