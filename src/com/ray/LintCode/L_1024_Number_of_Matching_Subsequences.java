/**
 * Description :
 *   Given string `S` and a dictionary of words `words`, find the number of `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `S`.

Subsequence is different from substring. Subsequences may not be continuous.
 *
 * Example :
 *   **Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "abcde", words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
Output: 2
```
