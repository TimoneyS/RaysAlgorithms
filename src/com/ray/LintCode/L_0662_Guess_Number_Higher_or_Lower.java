/**
 * 描述：
 *      We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 *      
 *      I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.
 *      
 *      Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you if this number is greater or less than the number you guessed.
 *      
 *      You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
 *      -1 means this number is less than the number you guessed
 *      
 *      1 means this number is greater than the number you guessed
 *      
 *      0 means this number is equal to the number you guessed
 *
 * 用例：
 *      **Example 1:**
 *      ```
 *      Input : n = 10, I pick 4 (but you don't know)
 *      Output : 4
 *      ```
 *
 * 挑战：
 *      
 *
 * 难度： Simple
